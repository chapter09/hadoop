### HDFS putx command

For some reason, I have to specify the data storage location in HDFS. I checked
this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32779439/how-to-let-the-hdfss-replica-blocks-position-be-set-by-myself)
and this [patch](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2576).

I have added a command named `putx` to the DFS command family. It's a variant of 
the command `put`.

#### Usage

```shell
hdfs dfs -putx -f src dst favored_nodes
```

Examples:

Using hostname
```shell
❯ hdfs dfs -putx -f test2 / hao-ml-1
writeStreamToFile [hao-ml-1:50010]
DFSOutput favoredNodes[hao-ml-1:50010]
DFSOutput nodes: hao-ml-1:50010(10.12.3.40:50010)
```

or Using IP address:

```shell
❯ hdfs dfs -putx -f test2 / 10.12.3.38
writeStreamToFile [/10.12.3.38:50010]
DFSOutput favoredNodes[10.12.3.38:50010]
DFSOutput nodes: hao-ml-3:50010(10.12.3.38:50010)
```

`favoredNodes` is your input. `nodes` are generated by namenode target choosing 
policy. So there's no guarantee that the `favoredNodes` will be enforced.

However, you could repeat `putx` with `-f` until it succeeds placing the data on 
the node you prefer. 

Failure examples:

```shell
❯ hdfs dfs -putx -f test2 / hao-ml-1
writeStreamToFile [hao-ml-1:50010]
DFSOutput favoredNodes[hao-ml-1:50010]
DFSOutput nodes: hao-ml-3:50010(10.12.3.38:50010)
17/06/27 11:16:20 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: These favored nodes were specified but not chosen: [hao-ml-1:50010] Specified favored nodes: [hao-ml-1:50010]
```

#### Todo

- [ ] replace the `nodes` with the `favoredNodes` to implement one-shot enforcement.
